# RTOS_STM32-f303RE
## WUT student project

---
## Introduction
The main goal of the project is to learn how to use RTOS system. Project was developed in **STM32CubeIDE** using development board **NUCLEO STM32-F303RE**.

## Getting started
After cloning repository and openning it in CubeIDE upload the code to the board. Open serial terminal. Use e.g. **Putty** app. Choose COM terminal and set: 115200 baudrate, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, None parity and XON/XOFF flow control.

There is task1 that sets ON on board LED when you press 'e' and sets it OFF when 'd' is pressed.
